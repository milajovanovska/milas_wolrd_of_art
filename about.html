    <h2>My Starting Journey: From a Child's Dream to Reality and My Everyday Lifestyle</h2>

        <p>Hi, I'm Mila Jovanovska, a 19-year-old from Skopje, North Macedonia. I’ve always been a dedicated
            student,
            winning awards and participating in competitions in math, arts, and languages. I’m currently pursuing my
            undergraduate studies at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering at UKIM.
            <br>
            <br>
            Art has always played a big role in my life. I started with crafts like origami and clay, but painting
            became my true passion. Over the past few years, I’ve been attending painting sessions with a
            professional
            artist, where I’ve learned important techniques and grown both artistically and personally.
            <br>
            <br>
            Today, I’m focused on combining art with technology. I believe my creativity and communication skills
            are
            valuable assets, and I’m motivated to keep learning, improving, and expressing myself through both code
            and
            canvas.

            In 2024, I fulfilled a childhood dream by organizing my first solo exhibition, "Happiness, Joy, Step Forward".
            It was a deeply meaningful experience of growth and creative expression – you can read about it
            <a href="exhibition.html" class="exhibition-link">here</a>.
            The same year, I launched a limited-edition unisex
            <a href="merch.html" class="exhibition-link">t-shirt</a> line featuring my original artwork.
            Each shirt included a print of one of my paintings on the back.
            The collection was sold both online and at Concept 37, Skopje.
            I'm incredibly grateful for the support and the warm feedback the project received.
